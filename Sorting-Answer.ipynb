    "Here, I will explain the psedocode of the following method.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will first start with identifying MC (Most likely to be a correct answer). We consider the answer as most likely to be a correct answer when the answer contain at least two key words either from Code 10 and Code 11. We will make the two groups of key words (What and How), so the answer get classified into MC when answer has at least one word from each group.\n",
    "    * For example, code 10's What group will be {Bubbles, Gas , They , etc...} and How group will be {light, less dense, not heavy, etc...}. If the student wrote \"Bubbles float because air inside the bubble is lighter than water\", the algorithm will classify the answer to MC group. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. We repeat the Step 1 for every Code of correct answer to finish the sorting to MC category.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now, out of all non-MC answer, we will identify CC (Likely to be a correct answer). If we look at the answer key, we can identify some important key words that the word alone makes the answer correct. When the answer contain at least one of this key words, then we identify the answer to category CC. \n",
    "    * For example, some key words for the bubble problem will be {less dense, not heavy, oxygen, carbon dioxide, light}. If the student wrote \"The thing inside is less dense than water\", this will not be classified into MC but CC.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Then we repeat the STEP 3 to identify LI (Likely to be a incorrect answer). \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Any blank answer or the answer that contains {don't know, no idea}, go to category I. Rest of them go to NC (Not classified)\n"
